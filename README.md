# Employee Sentiment Analysis

 - This project analyzes internal employee messages to label sentiment, monitor engagement, and identify potential flight risks.
 - It analyzes employee messages to evaluate sentiment and engagement.

## 2. Project Objective
   The main goal is to evaluate employee sentiment and engagement by performing the following:
    - Sentiment Labeling: Automatically label each message as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the data to understand its structure and underlying trends.
    - Employee Score Calculation: Compute a monthly sentiment score for each employee based on their messages.
    - Employee Ranking: Identify and rank employees by their sentiment scores.
    - Flight Risk Identification: A Flight risk is any employee who has sent 4 or more negative mails in a given month.
    - Predictive Modeling: Develop a linear regression model to further analyze sentiment trends.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/employee-sentiment-analysis.git

## Summary of Tasks

1. **Sentiment Labeling**: Messages were labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using TextBlob.
2. **EDA**: Visualizations showed sentiment distribution and message frequency over time.
3. **Score Calculation**: Monthly sentiment scores were computed per employee.
4. **Employee Ranking**: Employees ranked by monthly sentiment.
5. **Flight Risk Detection**: Identified employees with 4+ negative messages in any 30-day window.
6. **Predictive Modeling**: A linear regression model was built to forecast sentiment trends.
